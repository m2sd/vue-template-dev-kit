# Vue template dev kit

A very crude first draft for a template development kit.

Development comes with standard hot reload and a bundle analyzer.
  
For production builds the template is pre-rendered and above-the-fold CSS is extracted automatically.

The project also includes styleguidist which can be used to generate a styleguide for the template.

I, by no means, am an expert on vue or webpack, but i needed a templating engine and didn't find anything to satisfy my needs so I set up this little project.  
If I have time i will continue tinkering with it.

If you like my approach and want to improve upon it, feel free to fork :)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 and bundle analyzer at localhost:8888
npm run dev

# build for production with pre-rendering, above-the-fold extraction and minification
npm run build
```

## Additional features
